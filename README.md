<strong><u>Play modul-pilihan</u></strong> 🎮<br>

<b>modul-pilihan is a Script where you can find all The modul that Are available for termux as well as All the modul that are available in Termux Repository. I have also included some modul that are on GitHub or written in other languages other than bash like imron1997 and 2048. This Script is not complete yet, I am still working on it so I will add more modul in the Future.</b>
